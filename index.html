        <h2>MLB history</h2>
        <p>        <p>The history of Major League Baseball (MLB) can be traced back to the mid-19th century, when baseball was first played in the United States. The first professional baseball league, the National Association, was founded in 1871, but it lasted only five years. The modern MLB was founded in 1903 as a merger between the American League and the National League, with the first World Series championship contested that same year. Over the years, the league has expanded and evolved, with new teams joining and rules changing to accommodate new technologies and player strategies. </p>
