        <h2>MLB History</h2>
        The history of Major League Baseball (MLB) dates back to the mid-19th century when baseball was first played in the United States. The sport quickly gained popularity, leading to the formation of the first professional baseball league, the National Association, in 1871. However, the National Association lasted only five years. In 1903, the modern MLB was established through a merger between the American League and the National League. The inaugural World Series championship was contested the same year, marking the beginning of a tradition that continues to this day. Over the years, MLB has expanded and evolved, with new teams joining and rules changing to adapt to new technologies and player strategies. It has become an integral part of American sports culture, capturing the hearts of millions of fans and producing legendary players and iconic moments that have shaped the game's rich history.
